# Jas-Guitar-lessons
application written in Java, JavaFX  with a derby Database 
This application gives guitar teachers the opportunity to insert, update and delete Items like songs, instrumentals, chords and more

And gives pupils the opportunity to see, print or modify an Item into a pdf file ( so it's possible to send it per mail and so on )

 

The difference itâ€™s fully build up without a scene builder and the database is written in java ( by using a derby database )

You have 2 GUIs one for the teacher ,one for the pupil

The inserting , updating and deleting of any item in this application  happens in the front end
